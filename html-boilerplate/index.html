        <p id ="tribute-info"> <strong>Emiliano Zapata Salazar</strong> (8 August 1879 – 10 April 1919) became a leading figure in the Mexican Revolution of
             1910–1920, the main leader of the peasant revolution in the Mexican state of Morelos, and the inspiration of the agrarian movement called
              Zapatismo.

            Zapata was born in the rural village of Anenecuilco in Morelos State, in an era when peasant communities came under increasing pressure from the
             small-landowning class who monopolized land and water resources for sugar-cane production with the support of dictator Porfirio Díaz
              (President 1877-1880 and 1884-1911). Zapata early on participated in political movements against Diaz and the landowning hacendados, and when
               the Revolution broke out in 1910 he was positioned as a central leader of the peasant revolt in Morelos. Cooperating with a number of other
                peasant leaders, he formed the Liberation Army of the South, of which he soon became the undisputed leader. Zapata's forces contributed to
                 the fall of Díaz, defeating the Federal Army in the Battle of Cuautla (May 1911), but when the revolutionary leader Francisco I. Madero
                  became president he disavowed the role of the Zapatistas, denouncing them as simple bandits. In November 1911 Zapata promulgated the Plan
                   de Ayala, which called for substantial land reforms, redistributing lands to the peasants. Madero sent the Federal Army to root out the
                    Zapatistas in Morelos. Madero's generals employed a scorched-earth policy, burning villages and forcibly removing their inhabitants, and
                     drafting many men into the Army or sending them to forced-labor camps in southern Mexico. Such actions strengthened Zapata's standing
                      among the peasants, and Zapata succeeded in driving the forces of Madero (led by Victoriano Huerta) out of Morelos. In a coup against
                       Madero in February 1913, Huerta took power in Mexico, but a coalition of Constitutionalist forces in northern Mexico led by
                        Venustiano Carranza, Álvaro Obregón and Francisco "Pancho" Villa ousted him in July 1914 with the support of Zapata's troops.
                         Zapata did not recognize the authority that Carranza asserted as leader of the revolutionary movement, continuing his adherence
                          to the Plan de Ayala.</p>
